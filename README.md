# 🚀 ATS Resume Checker
### **Local LLM-Powered, Deterministic Applicant Tracking System**

A 🔐 **privacy-first ATS resume analyzer** that evaluates how well a resume matches a job description directly from real job postings.

Unlike black-box AI tools, this system is designed to behave like a **real enterprise Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** by prioritizing job-driven skill extraction and deterministic scoring logic over unpredictable generative output.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔍 Live Job Analysis:** Extract job descriptions directly from LinkedIn, company career pages (Greenhouse, Lever, etc.) without manual copy-pasting.
* **🧠 ATS-Realistic Scoring:** Skills are extracted dynamically from the job description. Required skills are weighted more heavily than preferred skills.
* **🤖 Local & Deterministic AI:** Uses **Ollama** (Phi-3) with `temperature: 0`. AI is restricted to experience refinement; core scoring remains rule-based and repeatable.
* **🧱 Quality Validation:** Rejects low-information resumes (e.g., just a name) to prevent artificial score inflation.
* **🔐 Privacy-First:** 100% local processing. No cloud APIs, no data leaks, no external resume uploads.
* **🐳 Dockerized Backend:** Reproducible environment for easy deployment on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **Chrome Extension:** Extracts JD from the active tab and sends it to the backend.
2. **Node.js Engine:** Normalizes text, cleans data, and extracts specific skills.
3. **Scoring Logic:** Applies weights based on "Required" vs "Preferred" keywords.
4. **Local LLM:** Provides a bounded bonus for experience relevance (via Ollama).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | Chrome Extension (Manifest V3), JavaScript, HTML, CSS |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **AI / LLM** | Ollama (Phi-3), Deterministic Local Inference |
| **DevOps** | Docker, Git |

## ⚙️ How the Scoring Works

* **Job-Driven Extraction:** Only skills relevant to the specific job post are evaluated.
* **Normalization:** Map aliases (e.g., `Node.js` → `node`, `CI/CD` → `cicd`) to reduce false negatives.
* **Weighted Classification:** Keywords near "required" or "must-have" carry higher mathematical weight.
* **Bounded LLM Refinement:** The LLM provides a minor score adjustment based on the *relevance* of experience but cannot override the core skill match.
